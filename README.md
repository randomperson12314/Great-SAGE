# 🧠 Great SAGE — Your Smart AI Guided Entity

**Offline Desktop AI Assistant for Windows 11**  
Private. Powerful. Fully Local.  
Built by one developer. Now open-sourced for debugging and community-driven growth.

---

## 🚀 What is Great SAGE?

Great SAGE is a fully functional AI desktop assistant designed to run entirely **offline**. It integrates voice control, local LLMs, file management, automation, and a full GUI — all built to deliver a true next-gen assistant experience without cloud dependency.

## 👤 Who Built It?

🛠️ **Created solo by Aayan**  
I built this during my high school exam break — designing, coding, integrating, and debugging it from the ground up.

Due to time constraints and academic commitments, I’m now open-sourcing it so the community can:

- Fix the remaining bugs  
- Optimize the pipeline  
- Push it beyond the prototype phase

## 💡 What Makes It Special

✅ Runs **Locally** — Fully offline, private assistant  
✅ **Voice Controlled** — Wake word + natural commands  
✅ **Modular Python Stack** — Easy to extend and adapt  
✅ **LLM-Enabled** — Supports local inference via MythoMax (13B)  
✅ **GUI + Avatar** — Tkinter-based interface with animated assistant

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🗣️ Wake-word detection + offline speech recognition (Vosk/Porcupine)  
- 🧠 Local LLM integration (MythoMax 13B via `llama.cpp` or `ollama`)  
- 📂 Voice-driven file/app control (open, move, delete, organize)  
- 📅 Reminders and daily utilities (WhatsApp, weather, news)  
- 🎨 Voice-based image generation (Stable Diffusion)  
- 📁 Photo auto-sorting via facial recognition  
- 🔄 Media conversion tools (PDF ↔ Word, MP4 → MP3)  
- 🔐 Face + password login system  
- 📱 Android-PC sync (Scrcpy / KDE Connect)

## 🛠️ Current Status

Great SAGE is **complete in architecture** but has **bugs across the GUI–voice–LLM pipeline**. The assistant launches and functions, but needs:

- Debugging of integration issues  
- Performance optimization  
- General polish and cleanup

# 🧠 Great SAGE — Your Smart AI Guided Entity

> **Offline Desktop AI Assistant** for Windows 11
> Private. Powerful. Fully Local.
> **Built by one developer. Now open-sourced for debugging and community-driven growth.**

## 🚀 What is Great SAGE?

Great SAGE is a fully functional AI desktop assistant designed to run **entirely offline**. It integrates voice control, local LLMs, file management, automation, and a full GUI — all built to give users a true next-gen assistant experience without any cloud dependencies.

## 👤 Who Built It?

> 🛠️ **Created solo by Aayan (`Python21`)**
> I built this during my high school exam break — designing, coding, integrating, and debugging it from the ground up.

Due to time constraints and upcoming academic commitments, I’m now open-sourcing it to the community in hopes that others can:

* Fix the remaining bugs
* Optimize the pipeline
* Push it beyond the prototype phase

## 💡 What Makes It Special

✅ **Runs Locally** — Fully offline, private assistant
✅ **Voice Controlled** — Wake word + natural commands
✅ **Modular Python Stack** — Easy to extend and adapt
✅ **LLM-Enabled** — Supports local inference via MythoMax (13B)
✅ **GUI + Avatar** — Tkinter-based interface with animated assistant

## 🔧 Core Features

* 🗣️ Wake word detection + offline speech recognition (Vosk, Porcupine)
* 🧠 Local LLM integration via `llama.cpp` or `ollama`
* 📂 Voice-driven file/app control: open, move, delete, organize
* 📅 Set reminders and execute daily utilities (WhatsApp, weather, news)
* 🎨 Generate images using Stable Diffusion from voice prompts
* 📁 Auto-sort photos via facial recognition (InsightFace)
* 🔄 Media tools: PDF ↔ Word, video to MP3 (ffmpeg)
* 🔐 Face + password login system
* 📱 Android sync with KDE Connect/Scrcpy
* 🎭 Assistant modes: calm, minimal, energetic

## 🛠️ Current Status

Great SAGE is **complete in architecture but has bugs** across the GUI–voice–LLM pipeline.
The assistant **launches and functions**, but needs:

* Debugging of occasional integration issues
* Performance tuning for smoother user experience
* General polish and cleanup
